# Kuka Arm Robotics Pick and Place Project

This project uses a simulated version of the [Kuka KR210](https://www.kuka.com/en-us/products/robotics-systems/industrial-robots/kr-210-2-f-exclusive) 6 DOF robotic arm to pick items from a shelf and deposit them into a storage container.

![Kuka Gazebo][kuka]

Tasks to be performed:

* Identify the target object on the shelf (placement may be randomized)
* Complete movement towards the target object
* Pickup the target object
* Complete movement towards the drop-off 
* Efficiently place the object at the drop-off
